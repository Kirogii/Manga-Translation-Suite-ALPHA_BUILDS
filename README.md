# Manga-Translation-Suite-ALPHA_BUILDS
* DISCLAIMER: NOT ALL FEATURES IN THESE BUILDS WORK
  
This is alpha builds of every major version you can test/use alpha builds here i will upload periodically if I update the program with early builds before release

No guides in most cases tho just follow the guide from https://github.com/Kirogii/Manga-Translation-Suite

Otherwise if you wish to setup android support just install node and install with npm localtunnel and then run androidserver after app.py starts (this is sort of unsafe as of now so dont use it as like a production setting)
